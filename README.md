## Leadership Team

**Gary Mass** - Co-Founder & Strategic Director  
I co‑founded Inner Circle Distribution and now guide its long‑range strategy with trusted partners and a skilled team. As an entertainment & production tech distributor, we help 350+ professional customers across North America find—and keep—the right gear. Back then, our "warehouse" was a Miami garage and the first shipment rode out in a stripped‑out minivan—two pallets of lighting gear bungee‑corded for a tour that became our first long‑term client. We've scaled a bit since.
